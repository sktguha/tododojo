so simple todo app
so todo is like done, a check box, then the text content

we render a widget. i.e give in its constructor

new todo({
done : false,
text : "content"
})

and append to the body

so app is also a widget

it will listen to click on plus button and add an widget to body
that's it. user can write the todo. on any change such
we can take out one event to write in storage
